# Classifying the Economic Impact on CO2 Emissions Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project explores the relationship between economic indicators (e.g., GDP per capita, fuel prices, and population density) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions across different countries. Using machine learning classification models, we aim to identify the most influential economic factors affecting emission levels.

## Objectives
- Analyze the correlation between economic indicators and CO2 emissions.
- Classify countries based on emission levels using Decision Tree and Random Forest.
- Identify key economic variables that significantly impact carbon emissions.
- Compare model performance and feature importance.

## Dataset
The analysis uses two datasets:
- **CO2 Emissions Dataset:** Contains country-wise data on total emissions and emissions per capita.
- **Economic Indicators Dataset:** Includes GDP per capita, fuel prices, urbanization rate, and population density.

## Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Machine Learning models: Decision Tree, Random Forest
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git & GitHub

## Key Insights
- Fuel prices and urbanization are top predictors of CO2 emission levels.
- Random Forest outperforms Decision Tree in classification accuracy.
- Countries with similar GDPs can have very different emission patterns depending on energy policy and population density.
